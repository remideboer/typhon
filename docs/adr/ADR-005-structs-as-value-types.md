## Context

Typhon needed a schema-fixed data carrier distinct from classes (behavior +
identity) and from `dict` (open keys, reference sharing). Requirements live in
`requirements/structs.typhon`.

## Decision

1. **`struct` / `fix struct`** are first-class declarations (sibling to `class`).
2. **Fields always public;** import access is `top_visibility` on the struct
   (`global` / `package` / `module`), not per-field modifiers.
3. **No identity features:** no methods, no `inherits` / `super` / `sealed` /
   `implements`; no `shared <Struct>`. A plain struct-typed field/binding cannot
   be `null`; ADR-023 permits explicit `nullable<Struct>` around a complete
   present value and nullable fields whose own types say so.
4. **Construction:** existing `Type(...)` call form only (positional + named);
   reject `new`; no brace field literals.
5. **Pass-by-value:** emit copies on assign / call / return (`_typhon_struct_copy` /
   `_typhon_copy`).
6. **Equality / hash:** field-wise `==`; hashable only when type-fix or every
   field is `fix` (emit frozen dataclass when hashable).
7. **Type params** allowed (`struct Pair<T, U>`), erased like class generics.

## Consequences

- Sem enforces SA mutability / ctor rules; emit uses `@dataclass`.
- Pedagogy: JIT J-struct + supportive S6 contrast dict/class.
- IDE maturity: declaration grammar, go-to on types and fields, semantic
  tokens, hover/snippets (extension ≥ 0.0.37) — required before calling the
  feature “implemented” (feature-maturity DoD).
- Nullable does not weaken value semantics: copy/equality/hash apply to a
  present struct; `null` remains the absence state of the outer wrapper.
- Security boundaries (ADR-001) unchanged.

## Rejected alternatives

- Brace field literals / `new` constructors
- Reference semantics with optional clone
- Methods or inheritance on structs
- Per-field `public` / `private` / `protected` / `module` (redundant with value
  semantics; use struct `top_visibility` instead)
