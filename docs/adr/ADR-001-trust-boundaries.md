## Context

Typhon is used in classrooms and with arbitrary folders. Passive IDE must analyze
`.typhon` on open/save; Run must execute generated Python with declared deps.
Those are different trust levels. Collapsing them (workspace on `PYTHONPATH`,
import-during-analyze, install-on-transpile) turns editing into an execution
surface.

## Decision

1. **Passive IDE / transpile / `compile_typhon`:** fail closed — isolated helper
   (`python -I`, bundled code only), workspace realpath containment when
   `TYPHON_WORKSPACE_ROOT` is set, no pip install, no third-party import for typing
   by default.
2. **Explicit Run / Debug:** allowed only in a trusted workspace; may install
   from a hashed lock and use runtime introspection.
3. **Explicit host-runtime install (activate / Create Project / Run):** when
   Python (always) or Node (JavaScript target) is missing from PATH, the
   extension may prompt **Install** and run the OS package manager (`winget` /
   `brew`) or open official docs in a **visible** terminal — only after Yes in
   a trusted workspace. No silent download of foreign binaries into the
   extension.
4. **Project files must not choose the interpreter binary** (`interpreter.path`
   rejected); the operator chooses Python by how they invoke the tool (or via
   the explicit install prompt above).
5. **Opt-in Go to Definition into locked `typhon.deps`:** extension setting
   `typhon.navigateLibrarySources` (default **false**) may pass
   `--library-sources` on **symbol lookup only**, so F12 can open Python
   sources from the hashed env. Diagnostics / save analysis stay fail-closed.
   Requires a trusted workspace. Does not enable analysis-time imports for
   squiggles.

## Consequences

- Diagnostics may be less precise about third-party members than Run-time typing.
- Contributors must not “fix” IDE features by restoring workspace `PYTHONPATH`
  or analysis-time imports without superseding this ADR and CER-001.
- Extension packaging must keep shipping a bundled transpiler for helpers.
- Library navigation is a deliberate privilege (setting + workspace trust), not
  the default edit path.
- Host runtime install is operator-driven (curated version list + package
  manager / docs), never analysis-time and never unattended on untrusted
  folders.

## Rejected alternatives

- Trust the workspace on open (convenient; unsafe for untrusted folders)
- Always import deps for richer squiggles (executes package top-level code)
