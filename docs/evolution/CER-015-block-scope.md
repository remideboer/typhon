| Scope | `sem.py` `_check_bindings`; `emit/python.py` brace mangle + lambda capture defaults; goldens; `tests/test_block_scope.py` |
| ADRs | (language scoping; complements ADR-012 loop capture) |

## Context

`{ }` bodies looked like scopes to students, but emit used Python `for x in …`
and sem added the binder to the outer `declared` set. After the loop, `x` still
existed; a later `int x = 10` reassigned the same binding. The debugger correctly
showed that leaked local — the defect was language/emit, not DAP.

### Pre-behavior

- Foreach / C-style binders: `declared.add(stmt.var)` on the outer env; emit
  `for x in …` / `for i in range(…)`.
- `if` / `while` / `switch` / `repeat` bodies shared the parent `declared` dict.
- Lambda capture defaults used the Typhon free name (`_c_i=i`) even when the outer
  binder was already mangled.

### Why it hurt

- Violated the teaching expectation that braces introduce scope.
- Debugger “`x` still in scope” after the loop was accurate Python, confusing
  relative to Typhon source.

### Post-behavior

- `_check_bindings` nests copies of `declared` / `types` / … for brace bodies;
  foreach / for-range binders exist only in the nested env.
- Emit mangles brace-local names to `_typhon_bN_<name>`, records `debug_names` for
  DAP display, and applies renames in expressions, interpolated strings, and
  **string lvalues** (indexed / dotted assigns such as `this.map[c.getId()] = c`).
- DAP: pysmap `names` must win over `hidePrefixes` (`_typhon_`), otherwise
  Variables/inline values drop brace locals (CER-014 / extension 0.0.55).
- Lambda capture defaults use the current outer rename (`_c_i=_typhon_b1_i`).
- `docs/LANGUAGE.md` documents block-scoped binders / brace locals.

### Evidence

`tests/test_block_scope.py` (incl. indexed assign binder rewrite); lambda
foreach capture; updated goldens `ebnf__control_flow__loops.py`,
`fixtures__integration_core.py`.

## Entry 2 — Indexed assign LHS skipped brace rename (2026-08-09)

### Pre-behavior

Assign emit used `stmt.name` verbatim when `"[" in name`, so
`this.byId[c.getId()] = c` became `self.byId[c.getId()] = _typhon_bN_c`.

### Post-behavior

`_rewrite_emitted_names` applies `_lambda_rename` to assign / aug-assign
lvalues (same word-boundary pass as interpolations).
