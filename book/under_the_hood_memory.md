## A process sees a private address space

RAM is physical storage made from addressable bytes. A modern operating system
normally gives each process a **virtual address space**: addresses that look
private and continuous to that process while the OS and hardware map them to
physical memory.

This isolation is why two programs can use the same-looking virtual address
without sharing a variable. Normal code in one process cannot accidentally
read an unrelated process's memory.

Operating systems and runtimes commonly organize process memory into areas
with roles such as:

- executable machine code;
- static or global runtime data;
- dynamically managed memory, commonly called the **heap**;
- one **call stack** per thread.

Real layouts vary by operating system, CPU, runtime, and optimization. Treat
these names as a map for reasoning, not as a Typhon storage guarantee.

## Function calls form a stack

When one function calls another, the runtime must remember where to return,
which arguments were passed, and which local names belong to that call. This
record is a **stack frame**. A later call sits above its caller and finishes
first: last in, first out.

```typhon
function int addOne(int number) {
    int result = number + 1
    return result
}

function int doubledAfterAddingOne(int number) {
    int changed = addOne(number)
    return changed * 2
}

print(doubledAfterAddingOne(5))
```

Output:

```text
12
```

Conceptually, the active calls are:

```text
top-level entrypoint
└─ doubledAfterAddingOne(number = 5)
   └─ addOne(number = 5)
```

<figure class="concept-diagram" role="img" aria-label="Three nested call stack frames with the newest function on top">
  <div class="diagram-stack">
    <div class="diagram-box"><strong>Top: addOne(5)</strong><span>returns 6 first</span></div>
    <div class="diagram-box"><strong>doubledAfterAddingOne(5)</strong><span>receives 6 and returns 12</span></div>
    <div class="diagram-box"><strong>Bottom: entrypoint</strong><span>prints 12</span></div>
  </div>
  <figcaption>The newest call is the first frame to return.</figcaption>
</figure>

`addOne` returns first, then `doubledAfterAddingOne`, then control returns to
the entrypoint. Debugger stack views show this same relationship, even though
the emitted Python runtime controls the concrete frame representation.

Uncontrolled recursion keeps adding frames until the runtime refuses another
one. That failure is called a **stack overflow** (or, in Python, may first
appear as a recursion-depth error).

## The heap and reachability

Data often needs to outlive the function that created it or have a size that
is known only while the program runs. Runtimes commonly manage such data in
heap storage.

Python—and therefore the current Typhon backend—uses automatic memory
management. When an object is no longer reachable, the runtime may reclaim
its storage. You do not write `free(...)` in Typhon.

Garbage collection prevents common manual-memory mistakes such as using an
object after freeing it, but it does not make memory unlimited. A program can
still retain too much reachable data and run out of memory.

## Language meaning is not physical location

It is tempting to teach “local means stack” and “object means heap” as an
absolute rule. That shortcut breaks under optimization, managed runtimes,
closures, and captured variables. Typhon specifies how values behave; it does
not currently promise where each value is physically stored.

For example, class variables share an object reference, while structs have
copy-on-assignment value behavior:

```typhon
class Counter {
    private int value

    public constructor(int value) {
        this.value = value
    }

    public increment() {
        this.value = this.value + 1
    }

    public int current() {
        return this.value
    }
}

struct Point {
    int x
    int y
}

Counter firstCounter = Counter(1)
Counter secondCounter = firstCounter
secondCounter.increment()
print(firstCounter.current())

Point firstPoint = Point(1, 2)
Point secondPoint = firstPoint
secondPoint.x = 9
print(firstPoint.x)
print(secondPoint.x)
```

Output:

```text
2
1
9
```

Both counter names reach the same class instance, so mutation through one name
is visible through the other. Assigning the struct creates an independent
value, so changing `secondPoint` leaves `firstPoint` unchanged.

This is a **semantic** distinction. The Python emitter may represent both with
Python objects internally while preserving Typhon's different assignment rules.
Likewise:

- `data` is an immutable value object with all-fields equality;
- `entity` is a reference-like domain object whose declared identity fields
  determine equality;
- `class` has ordinary object identity and mutable encapsulated state;
- `struct` is an identity-free copied value.

Choose among them for those language meanings, not because you are guessing a
stack or heap address.

### Class-wide vs per-instance: `static`

A normal field lives **on each instance**. A `static` field is **one cell for
the whole class** — shared by every object of that type (and reachable without
an instance). A `static` method has **no `this`**: it belongs to the class,
not to one object.

```typhon
class IdCounter {
    public static int total = 0

    public constructor() {
        IdCounter.total = IdCounter.total + 1
    }

    public static int getTotal() {
        return IdCounter.total
    }
}

IdCounter a = IdCounter()
IdCounter b = IdCounter()
print(IdCounter.getTotal())
```

Output:

```text
2
```

Both constructors bumped the **same** `IdCounter.total`. Writing `this` inside
`getTotal` is a compile error — there is no instance. Prefer
`ClassName.member` for static access. (C#, Java, and JavaScript use the same
keyword for this idea.)

## A process can contain several threads

A process owns an address space. A **thread** is one flow of execution inside
that process. Each thread has its own instruction position and call stack, but
threads in the same process can reach shared runtime data.

<figure class="concept-diagram" role="img" aria-label="Two threads with separate call stacks accessing shared runtime data in one process">
  <div class="diagram-threads">
    <div class="diagram-box"><strong>Thread 1</strong><span>instruction position<br>own call stack</span></div>
    <div class="diagram-box diagram-shared"><strong>Shared runtime data</strong><span>objects and state reachable by both threads</span></div>
    <div class="diagram-box"><strong>Thread 2</strong><span>instruction position<br>own call stack</span></div>
  </div>
  <figcaption>Separate call flows can still reach the same mutable state.</figcaption>
</figure>

That shared reachability creates races: two flows can read and update the same
state in an unsafe order. Typhon makes the intent visible:

- `tasks` / `task` describe concurrent work;
- `shared` says state is deliberately reachable from concurrent work;
- `atomic` provides indivisible operations for supported primitive counters
  and flags;
- `await` expresses dependencies between tasks.

The current backend may implement these constructs with Python runtime
facilities, but the Typhon contract is higher-level. Code should rely on Typhon's
`shared`, `atomic`, and `await` rules rather than on backend accidents such as
one particular Python implementation's scheduling.

## Failure modes now have a mechanical meaning

- **Stack overflow:** too many unfinished nested calls.
- **Out of memory:** the process cannot obtain more memory.
- **Race condition:** concurrent behavior depends on an unsafe ordering.
- **Panic:** a Typhon error outcome reached the entrypoint; this is a language
  boundary outcome, not a memory failure.

Keeping these categories separate makes diagnostics easier to understand. A
panic is not automatically a crash caused by corrupt memory, and a stack
overflow is not a recoverable `result<T,E>` business error.

## Check your understanding

> Without running code, explain why `secondCounter.increment()` changes what
> `firstCounter.current()` returns, while changing `secondPoint.x` does not
> change `firstPoint.x`. Then explain why two `IdCounter()` calls share one
> `IdCounter.total`, and why a `static` method cannot use `this`. Finally,
> name the resource exhausted by uncontrolled recursion and the concurrency
> problem prevented by a suitable atomic update.
