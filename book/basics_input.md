# 2.2. Processing input

Programs become useful when they react to **you**. Keyboard input is a
built-in Typhon function, like `print`: you call it with an optional prompt
string; it waits for Enter and returns what was typed as a `string`.

```typhon
string name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

*Sample session (your answers may differ):*

```text
What is your name? Ada
Hello, Ada!
```

What happens:

1. `input("What is your name? ")` — show the prompt, wait for Enter, return
   the typed text as a `string`.
2. We store that string in `name` and print a greeting.

You can also write `input()` with no prompt. Run the file, type a name,
press Enter.

## Numbers from text

What you type is always text first. To use it as a number, convert it
(see also [Conversion](basics_conversion.md)):

```typhon
string raw = input("How old are you? ")
int age = int(raw)
print("Next year you will be " + (age + 1))
```

*Interactive — type answers at the prompts; output depends on your input.*

`int(raw)` asks Typhon/Python to parse the string as an integer. If the text
is not a number, the program fails at that line — prefer
`parseInt` / `parseFloat` (same chapter family as [Conversion](basics_conversion.md)
and [Expressing success and failure](basics_outcomes.md)) when you need a
recoverable `result`.

### Exercise

> Ask for a first name and a favorite number. Print a sentence that uses
> both.
