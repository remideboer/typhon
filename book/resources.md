## How the computer runs your code

These optional book chapters explain the machinery without interrupting the
core language path:

- [From source file to running process](under_the_hood_entrypoint.md)
- [Processes, calls, and memory](under_the_hood_memory.md)

## Tooling

- Editor extension: `typhon-language/` (install via `python -m transpiler install extension`)
- Run a file: `python -m transpiler run path/to/file.typhon`
- Rebuild this HTML locally: `python book/build_html.py` (from `book/`)

## Online copy (GitHub Pages)

After Pages is set to **GitHub Actions** in the repo settings, the beginner
book is published from `book/html` by `.github/workflows/pages-book.yml`:

## Pedagogical model (credit)

Structure and beginner tone adapted from
**[Rust Development Classes](https://rust-classes.com/)** by
**Marcel Ibes** — see especially
[Back to the basics](https://rust-classes.com/basics).

## What to learn next
