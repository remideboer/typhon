# 9.2. Better Typhon with TDD

**Test-driven development** flips the order:

1. Write a failing check for behavior you want.
2. Write the smallest code that makes it pass.
3. Clean up names and structure while tests stay green.

<figure class="concept-diagram" role="img" aria-label="TDD cycle Red Green Refactor">
  <div class="diagram-states">
    <div class="diagram-state is-active"><strong>Red</strong><span>failing check</span></div>
    <div class="diagram-state"><strong>Green</strong><span>smallest pass</span></div>
    <div class="diagram-state"><strong>Refactor</strong><span>clean · stay green</span></div>
  </div>

    Feedback every few minutes — not ceremony for its own sake.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

For students, the win is not ceremony — it is feedback every few minutes.
Keep examples tiny: one function, two assertions, one commit of learning.

When a test “needs” a private field, treat that as a design smell: improve
the API (`package` / `public` methods), do not invent a language bypass.

### Exercise

> Using TDD order, implement `function string grade(int score)` that
> returns `"pass"` if `score >= 60`, else `"fail"`. Write the checks before
> the final body.
