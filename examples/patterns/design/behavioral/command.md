# Command

**Category:** Behavioral

## Intent

Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

## Explanation

`WriteCommand` binds an `Editor` receiver with a chunk of text. `execute` / `undo` turn edits into first-class objects you can store on a history stack.

## Classic structure (UML)

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Command {
        <<interface>>
        +execute()
        +undo()
    }
    class ConcreteCommand
    class Receiver
    class Invoker
    class Client
    Command <|.. ConcreteCommand
    ConcreteCommand --> Receiver
    Invoker --> Command
    Client --> ConcreteCommand
    Client --> Invoker
```

## This demo

`Command` is abstract; `WriteCommand` is ConcreteCommand; `Editor` is Receiver. The script acts as Client/Invoker calling execute then undo.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Command {
        <<interface>>
    }
    class WriteCommand
    class Editor
    Command <|.. WriteCommand
    WriteCommand --> Editor
```

## Real-world use cases

- Editor undo/redo stacks.
- Job queues and transactional work units.
- Macro recording: store a list of commands and replay them.

## Run

```text
python -m transpiler run examples/patterns/design/behavioral/command.typhon
```
