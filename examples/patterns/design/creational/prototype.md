# Prototype

**Category:** Creational

## Intent

Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.

## Explanation

Each product implements `clone()` and returns a new instance with copied state. Clients hold a prototype and clone it instead of calling constructors with many arguments. Useful when creation is expensive or when configurations are cloned and then tweaked.

## Classic structure (UML)

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Prototype {
        <<interface>>
        +clone()
    }
    class ConcretePrototype1
    class ConcretePrototype2
    class Client
    Prototype <|.. ConcretePrototype1
    Prototype <|.. ConcretePrototype2
    Client --> Prototype
```

## This demo

`Shape` requires `clone()`; `Circle` and `Rectangle` copy their fields into new instances.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Shape {
        <<interface>>
        +clone()
        +describe()
    }
    class Circle
    class Rectangle
    Shape <|.. Circle
    Shape <|.. Rectangle
```

## Real-world use cases

- Graphic editors: duplicate a selected shape with all style properties.
- Configuration templates cloned per environment, then overridden lightly.
- Avoiding costly re-init (parsed schemas, pre-warmed caches) by copying.

## Run

```text
python -m transpiler run examples/patterns/design/creational/prototype.typhon
