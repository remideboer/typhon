# Flyweight

**Category:** Structural  
**Demo:** [flyweight.typhon](flyweight.typhon)

## Intent

Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.

## Explanation

**Intrinsic** state (shared `TreeType` name/color) lives in flyweights from `TreeFactory`. **Extrinsic** state (x, y) lives on each `Tree` instance. Thousands of trees reuse few types instead of duplicating heavy data.

## Classic structure (UML)

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Flyweight {
        +operation(extrinsic)
    }
    class ConcreteFlyweight
    class FlyweightFactory
    class Client
    Flyweight <|-- ConcreteFlyweight
    FlyweightFactory --> ConcreteFlyweight
    Client --> FlyweightFactory
    Client --> Flyweight
```

## This demo

`TreeType` is the flyweight; `TreeFactory` caches types by name; `Tree` holds extrinsic coordinates and a shared type.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class TreeType
    class TreeFactory
    class Tree
    TreeFactory --> TreeType
    Tree --> TreeType
```

## Real-world use cases

- Text editors: one glyph object per character style reused across the document.
- Game maps: shared mesh/texture assets with per-instance transforms.
- Particle systems sharing material definitions across many particles.

## Run
