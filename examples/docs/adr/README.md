# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

ADRs capture **system-level** choices: boundaries, trust model, dependency
strategy, packaging, IDE vs CLI contracts. They answer “what shape should the
system keep?” — not “which function was slow?”

Code-level history (pre/post behavior of specific symbols) lives in
[`../evolution/`](../evolution/README.md) as **CERs**. Both are project memory:
**look back** before changing related code, and **write forward** (amend, add,
or supersede) in the same change set when a decision moves. See
`.cursor/rules/project-memory.mdc`.

## When to write or update an ADR

Write or update an ADR when the change:

- Alters a security or trust boundary
- Changes how deps / locks / interpreters are resolved
- Redesigns the compile pipeline stages or IDE helper contract
- Introduces a new backend, packaging channel, or public CLI surface
- Reverses or supersedes a previous ADR

Do **not** use an ADR for a local refactor or a measured micro-optimization —
that belongs in a CER (or a commit message if too small to record).

`requirements/` is a **local gitignored scratchpad** for draft specs while
designing a feature. It is **not** tracked and **not** permanent project memory.
When a feature lands, **copy** lasting content into permanent homes under
`docs/` (ADRs, LANGUAGE, CONCURRENCY, DATA_ENTITY, CERs) and the beginner
`book/` — including rationale tables, cross-language comparisons, didactic
notes, and **full bibliographic references**. An ADR “Source” path under
`requirements/` is provenance only — if the folder is empty on another machine,
permanent docs must still stand alone.

Regression `.typhon` samples that CI needs live under `tests/fixtures/` (e.g.
`rekenmachine.typhon`), not here.
