# T2 — Batch filter

**Whole task:** You receive a tiny shipment batch (id + label + weight). Print only the rows that should go to the **heavy** lane (weight ≥ 10), in a readable line each.

## Scaffolding

| Level | File | Your job |
|-------|------|----------|
| A Worked | [`1-worked.typhon`](1-worked.typhon) | Run; explain why the `if` sits *inside* the loop. |
| B Completion | [`2-completion.typhon`](2-completion.typhon) | Finish filtering + typed print. |
| C Conventional | [`3-brief.md`](3-brief.md) | New batch rules — your design. |

## JIT

- [Loop](../../jit/J-loop.md)
- [Control](../../jit/J-control.md)
- [Interpolation](../../jit/J-print-interpolate.md)

## Success criteria

1. Runs.  
2. Parallel arrays (or typed rows) make the batch columns explicit.  
3. Filter condition matches the brief (not “print everything”).  
4. You can justify loop-vs-branch placement in one sentence.
